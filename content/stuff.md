#### Here's a list of book that I want to read.

> _now or in the near future._

- TypeScript handbook by Basrat Ali.
- Composing software By Eric Elliot (For Functional Programming).
- NodeJS Design Patterns.
- The Linux Programming Interface.
- Designing data intensive applications.
  - Though I have read a bit of this book, I stopped reading cause I got bored. But now having worked with some particulary data intensive applications, this book should be fun to read again.
