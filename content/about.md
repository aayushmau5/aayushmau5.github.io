Hello, My name is Aayush Kumar Sahu, aka, aayushmau5(pronounced: aayushmouse, aayush-mow-five, aayushmouse-five :P).

I love Open-Source. Currently exploring the web.

I like to babble about `Open-Source`, `Javascript`, `Linux`, `Vim`(`vscode` works as well), `compilers`, or anything interesting :P

Feel free to reach out to me @:
