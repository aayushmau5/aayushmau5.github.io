Hello, My name is Aayush Kumar Sahu, aka, aayushmau5(pronounced: aayushmouse, aayush-mow-five, aayushmouse-five).

I love Open-Source. Currently exploring the web.

I like to babble(not _babel_) about `Open-Source`, `Javascript`, `Linux`, `Vim`(`vscode` works as well), `compilers`, or anything for that matter :P

Feel free to reach out to me @:
